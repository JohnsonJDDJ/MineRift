# MineRift

This project is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.com) minimap that imitates the [Summoner's Rift](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Summoner%27s_Rift) of the MOBA game [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), developed by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com). This project is developed during high school, during my class time (mostly) and free time (some). I revisited this map and was pretty amazed by the effort I put in back then. I think this project deserves some respect, so I made a showcase video and this repo to mark its existence in the history of the internet. 

> ⚠️ MineRift is only compatible with vanilla Minecraft version **1.13.2**.

## Game Objective

The whole idea is to play League of Legends in Minecraft (_this project is literally created because I can't play league in high school but I can play minecraft_). But, the game, as it develops, is now very different from League.

The ultimate objective is to, as a team, **gain 40 `points`**. **You will add one `point` to your opponents' team everytime you die**. This is the only way to increment `points` in this game, and there are no exceptions. You can ahieve the game objective mainly through outplaying your opponent and killing them. Every player have infinite lives, and players can revive their `hero` without any waiting time. 

## Heros

There are in total 10 `heros` to choose from. You will choose your `hero` and the start of the game, and you will play as that `hero` throughout the rest of your game.

Each `hero` have different weapons and abilities. Here is a very brief introduction on each `hero`:
