# MineRift

This project is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.com) minimap that imitates the [Summoner's Rift](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Summoner%27s_Rift) of the MOBA game [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), developed by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com). This project is developed during high school, during my class time (mostly) and free time (some). I revisited this map and was pretty amazed by the effort I put in back then. I think this project deserves some respect, so I made a showcase video and this repo to mark its existence in the history of the internet.
