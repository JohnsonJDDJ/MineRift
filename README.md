# MineRift

This project is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.com) minimap that imitates the [Summoner's Rift](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Summoner%27s_Rift) of the MOBA game [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), developed by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com). This project is developed during high school, during my class time (mostly) and free time (some). I revisited this map and was pretty amazed by the effort I put in back then. I think this project deserves some respect, so I made a showcase video and this repo to mark its existence in the history of the internet. 

> ⚠️ MineRift is only compatible with vanilla Minecraft version **1.13.2**.

## Objective

The whole idea is to play League of Legends in Minecraft (_this project is literally created because I can't play league in high school but I can play minecraft_). But, the game, as it develops, is now very different from League.

The ultimate objective is to, as a team, **gain 40 `points`**. **You will add one `point` to your opponents' team everytime you die**. This is the only way to increment `points` in this game, and there are no exceptions. You can ahieve the game objective mainly through outplaying your opponent and killing them. Every player have infinite lives, and players can revive their `hero` without any waiting time. 

## Heros

There are in total 10 `heros` to choose from. You will choose your `hero` and the start of the game, and you will play as that `hero` throughout the rest of your game.

Each `hero` have different weapons and abilities. Here is a very brief introduction on each `hero`:
- **Tank** the warrior. Tank is the bravest soul amoung all the `heros`. He is fully armored from the very start, and he can upgrade his armor by trading in the `shop`. He is literally un-killable, as he can regenerate his health in the middle of a fight. However, the price is a clumsy gait.
- **Elf** the archer. Elf, a innate bow wielder, uses her bow for everything. She not only can shot arrows, she could also use her bow as a weapon that hits. By upgrading her bow at the `shop`, she could further wield the power of fire on both her bow and her arrow. 
- **Prophet** the wizard. Prophet learned his magic from The End. He can teleport at his will, making him the most unpredictable killer of the game. His splash potions destroy living creatures within a second. Because his magic is so strong, traders of the `shop` have nothing to offer for him.
- **Nightingale** the assassin. No one can understand how Nightingale can make himself disappear in thin air. The potion he brewed for himself allows him to evaporate in front of his enemy and reappear at their most vulnarable spot. With only a pocket knife, he could rule the battlefield in the most unforgiving way. 
- **Boor** the rage warrior. Boor is the `hero` that is capable of doing the most catastrophic damage. She is the heroine of the game, tearing through the enemy with her boots and her axes. Her potion allows her to be the strongest fighter in the game for a period of time.
- **Deathknight** the rider. Deathknight returned from hell with its skeleton horse. We never know if its a he or its a she, but thats not important. With fulling upgradable armor that could be traded in the `shop`, Deathknight can trample through everything in front of its path. 
- **Poseidon** the aquaman. Inspired by Aquanman (2018), Poseidon is the king of the ocean. His holy tridents, both upgradable from the `shop`, can be used as a projectile or a melee weapon. Poseidon literally have no weakness under the power of his holy tridents. 
- **Wasteland** the boxer. This unusual `hero` is a restless fighter. Her weapoin is a literal cactus, but she feels no pain clenching it in her fists. Her helmet, covered in thorns, is absolutely unforgiving when you try to break it. 
- **Priest** the healer. Priest has her power from the sky above. Her wand can heal her and her allies, while damaging opponents around her. But don't mistaken her from her name. She could upgrade her wand from the `shop` to become a absolute damage machine. Or, she could choose another path and upgraed her wand to make her allies all become near immortals.
